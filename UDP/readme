Reliable UDP messaging protocol

https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp 

KCP uses 10-20% more bandwidth than TCP but reduces latency by 30-40% for short messaging. It also reduces
maximum latency by three fold. KCP has only two files:  ikcp.h and ikcp.c source files.

Note:
 KCP requires a round trip on the "connection" itself.
 In Omicro, a connectionless communication protocol is desired.
 it remains an unresolved issue where an ideal connectionless and reliable UDP messaging
 protocol and library is needed.
