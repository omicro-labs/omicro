# Consensus of Votes

In contrast to PoW and PoS, Omicro uses consensus of votes (CoV), where
all nodes in the network validate and vote for all transactions. It just takes
3 messages per node on average for a transaction to reach finality. Because of 
the light-weight activities performed by each node, the blockchain is highly scalable
and fast.


# Quantum Secure

When quantum computers become available, current blockchains can be broken in their
private and public key mechanics. Omicro uses post-quantum cryptography to protect
account identity and transaction processing. User accounts are represented by
quantum public and private keys. Transaction messages are signed and verified with
private and public keys of all participating nodes. This makes Omicro exceedingly secure.


# Green and Low Cost

Any regular computer can be a backer node and contribute to Omicro network as long as it
has reasonable amount of computer memory (DRAM), e.g. 8GB, 16GB, etc. Omicro nodes do not
need GPU, hashing, nor burn electricity. It will be made extremely easy for backers to join.
