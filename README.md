# Quantum Secure

When quantum computers become accessible, the private and public key mechanisms of current blockchains 
may be compromised. Omicro addresses this vulnerability by employing post-quantum cryptography to safeguard 
account identities and transaction processes. User accounts are secured using quantum-resistant public 
and private keys, while transaction messages are signed and verified with the private and public keys 
of all participating nodes. This advanced approach ensures Omicro's exceptional level of security.


# Consensus of Votes

Unlike PoW and PoS, Omicro employs a Consensus of Votes (CoV) mechanism, where all nodes in the 
network validate and vote on transactions. On average, only three messages per node are required 
for a transaction to achieve finality. Due to the lightweight operations performed by each node, 
the blockchain is highly scalable and exceptionally fast.
Users are not required to mine or deposit tokens on the Omicro network, which 
significantly saves resources. This makes the network both cost-efficient and powerful.


# Green and Low Cost

Any standard computer can serve as a backer node and contribute to the Omicro network, provided it has 
a reasonable amount of memory (e.g., 16GB ). Omicro nodes do not require GPUs, hashing, or 
excessive electricity consumption. Joining the network will be made exceptionally simple for backers.
